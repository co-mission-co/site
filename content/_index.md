    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>That night was different.</p>
    <p>
      It felt as if <i>the inspiration</i> had been waiting—quietly—until I was ready to receive it.
      The clarity was immediate. Calm. Almost magical.
    </p>
    <p>
      For months, probably years, I had been asking the same question:
      <strong>What is my true mission in life?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was happy at work and deeply grateful for my team, I felt I could give much more.
      Like many people searching for direction, I looked outward—towards individuals and
      organisations I deeply admire. People creating meaningful products, offering life-changing
      services, and contributing to a better world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I often saw ways things could be improved, yet I knew it would me take years to reach that point
      alone. And something didn’t feel right.
      I didn’t want to compete with people or companies I respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why compete with great souls and minds when collaboration is possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, the perspective shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came with clarity: my role wasn’t to outdo others—it was to walk alongside them.
      To support individuals and organisations in letting their missions unfold closer to their
      full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ideas I had been receiving before—strategic, creative, practical—weren’t meant to compete with others. They were meant to be shared. Small or meaningful contributions that could help a true
      mission take its next step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return, there could be a simple, conscious exchange. Not a rigid formula, but a fraction
      of the value created—shared in trust. Enough to sustain my support and extend it to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t know exactly how it would work. And that night, I was comfortable with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      What mattered was how it would be done: In cooperation.In connection. In consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night, everything found its place—the project's name, the first co-missionaries,
      and even the first idea of the logo as a reflection of what
      Co-Mission is meant to represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Co-mission wouldn't have customers or clients. It would have co-missionaries—individuals and organisations whose missions I respect and feel truly aligned with.
      And by supporting their mission, I'd also allow my own to unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the beginning of Co-Mission.co.
    </p>
    <p>
      A space where missions meet.
      Because we go further—not competing—but connected in consciousness.
      In awareness that missions evolve as we evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for reading co-mission's story.
