## Our Story

For many years, I had been asking the same questions: **What is my true mission in life? Is what I'm doing really aligned with it?**

One night, I received what I'd call clear intuitive guidance.

It felt as if *the inspiration* I needed had been waiting quietly until I was ready to receive it. The clarity was almost magical.

While I was happy at work and deeply grateful for my team and the work I'd been doing for my clients, I felt I could give much more to this world.

Like many people searching for direction, I always looked outward—towards individuals and organisations I deeply admired, trying to find role models and inspiration. These were people creating meaningful products, offering life-changing services, and contributing to a better world. Many of them I knew because I was using their products or services.

I often saw ways their offerings could be improved, yet I knew it would take me years to reach that point myself if I wanted to offer something similar. And something didn't feel right. I didn't want to compete with people or organisations I admired and respected.

**Why compete with great souls, minds, and teams when collaboration is possible?**

That night, the perspective shifted.

The answer came with clarity: my role wasn't to outdo others—it was to walk alongside them. To support individuals and organisations in letting their missions unfold closer to their full potential.

The ideas I had been receiving—strategic, creative, practical insights on how to improve their services or products—weren't meant to compete with them. They were meant to be shared.

These could be small or meaningful contributions that could help a true mission take its next step forward.

In return, there could be a simple, conscious exchange. Not a rigid formula, but a portion of the value created—shared in trust. Enough to sustain my support and keep extending it to others.

I didn't know exactly how it would work. And I was comfortable with that.

What mattered was how it would be done: **In cooperation. In connection. In consciousness.**

That same night, everything found its place—the project's name, the first co-missionaries, and even the first idea for the logo as a reflection of what Co-Mission is meant to represent.

Co-Mission wouldn't have customers or clients. It would have **co-missionaries**—individuals and organisations whose missions I respect and feel truly aligned with. By supporting their mission, I'd also allow my own to unfold.

That was the beginning of Co-Mission.co.

A space where missions meet. Because we go further—not competing—but connected in consciousness. In awareness that missions evolve as we evolve.

Thanks for reading Co-Mission's story. And I hope we can find ways to co-mission.
